# 3. Use `async`/`await` pattern over `Promise.then`

Date: 2023-02-15

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

There are a few ways to implement asynchronous method calls, such as `async`/`await` and `Promise.then`, but we should standardise for consistency.

## Decision

We will use the `async`/`await` pattern

## Consequences

This should bring more consistency to the codebase and reduce boilerplate code.
