# 1. Prefer 'Prisoner' Over 'Offender'

Date: 2022-12-07

## Status

âœ… Accepted

## Context

The terms 'offender' and 'prisoner' are often used interchangeably but this causes issues when trying to remember if in
a particular bit of code we have decided to use one term or another.

## Decision

We will prefer to use the term 'prisoner' wherever possible - this service is inherently prisoner focussed.

## Consequences

This should bring much more consistency to the codebase and make it easier to develop. There will no longer be an issue
deciding what to name a file, class, method etc.
